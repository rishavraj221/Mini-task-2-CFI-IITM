Project 1 : Ambient Sound Light Show

Problem Statement - Using frequency content we will analyze ambient sound and display it on strip of LEDs

Ideation - 

Understand the device mechanism - 

Electret microphone -> 2k2 bias resistor

SPI buss connections -> DotStar LED strip and an analog pot input

Arduino IDE + Sony Spresense board -> serial port with a terminal to get a reading on the processing time
